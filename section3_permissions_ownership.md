Goal
====
Understand **who can access files**, **how**, and **how to control it**.

You’ll learn to read permission strings, modify them safely, and manage ownership properly.

---

Why Permissions Matter
======================
Permissions protect your system and data from unauthorized changes.

Each file and directory has:
- **Owner** — the user who owns it.
- **Group** — users sharing the same project/team.
- **Others** — everyone else.

Each of these can have **read**, **write**, or **execute** rights.

---

Viewing Permissions — `ls -l`
=============================
List files with detailed information:

```bash
ls -l
```

Example output:

```bash
-rwxr-xr-- 1 student staff  1024 Oct 22 10:30 script.sh
```

Parts of the first field (`-rwxr-xr--`):

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---------|----------|
| `-` | file type (`-`=file, `d`=directory, `l`=symlink) |
| `r` | read permission |
| `w` | write permission |
| `x` | execute permission |
| `-` | permission missing |

Grouped as: **user / group / others** → `rwx r-x r--`.

---

Basic Permission Categories
===========================
| Entity | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **User (u)** | The file owner | `rwx` |
| **Group (g)** | Members of the file’s group | `r-x` |
| **Others (o)** | Everyone else | `r--` |

Example string breakdown:

```
-rwxr-xr--
 ↑   ↑   ↑
 u   g   o
```

Each group has three bits — total 9 permission bits.

---

Changing Permissions — `chmod` (symbolic)
=========================================
Change permissions using symbolic notation.

Format:

```
chmod [who][operator][permission] file
```

Examples:

```bash
chmod u+x script.sh     # give user execute permission
chmod g-w file.txt      # remove group write permission
chmod o+r notes.txt     # allow others to read
chmod a-rwx test.log    # remove all access for everyone
```

Who: `u` (user), `g` (group), `o` (others), `a` (all)  
Operators: `+` (add), `-` (remove), `=` (set exactly)

---

Changing Permissions — `chmod` (octal)
======================================
Each permission is represented by a **number**:

| Permission | Binary | Value |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| read (r) | 100 | 4 |
| write (w) | 010 | 2 |
| execute (x) | 001 | 1 |

Sum them per group → **rwx = 7**, **r-x = 5**, **r-- = 4**.

Example:

```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
```

Breakdown:

| User | Group | Others | Mode |
|-------|--------|---------|------|
| rwx | r-x | r-x | 755 |

---

Common Octal Modes
==================
| Mode | Meaning | Use case |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| `644` | rw‑r‑‑r‑‑ | normal text files |
| `600` | rw‑‑‑‑‑‑ | private files |
| `755` | rwx‑r‑x‑r‑x | executable scripts, public dirs |
| `700` | rwx‑‑‑‑‑‑ | private scripts |
| `777` | rwx‑rwx‑rwx | full access (dangerous) |

**Avoid 777** unless in temporary environments.

---

Changing Ownership — `chown`
============================
Set the file’s owner (and optionally group).

```bash
sudo chown alice file.txt
```

Change both owner and group:

```bash
sudo chown alice:developers project/
```

Recursively change everything inside a directory:

```bash
sudo chown -R alice:developers /var/www/
```

Only root or file owners can change ownership.

---

Changing Group Ownership — `chgrp`
==================================
Change only the group part of ownership.

```bash
sudo chgrp staff report.txt
```

Useful when multiple users share access via a group.

---

Default Permissions — `umask`
=============================
`umask` defines what permissions **new files** start with.

Display your current mask:

```bash
umask
```

Example output: `0022` → means remove write for *group* and *others*.

Base defaults:
- Files start as `666` (rw-rw-rw-)
- Directories start as `777` (rwxrwxrwx)

So, `666 - 022 = 644` → normal default for new files.

---

Special Permission Bits
=======================
In addition to basic read/write/execute, three **special bits** exist:

| Bit | Applies to | Symbol | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **setuid** | Executable files | `s` in user field | Run as file’s owner |
| **setgid** | Executables / directories | `s` in group field | Run as file’s group; new files inherit group |
| **sticky bit** | Directories | `t` in others field | Only owner can delete own files |

---

setuid Example
==============
If a binary has setuid bit, it runs as its owner (often root).

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
```

You’ll see:

```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root ...
```

The `s` in the user part means it runs with owner privileges.

---

setgid Example
==============
For executables:

- `setgid` means they run with the group of the file.  

For directories:

- Files created inside inherit the directory’s group.

```bash
chmod g+s shared_dir
```

This helps in group collaboration environments.

---

Sticky Bit Example
==================
Used on shared directories like `/tmp` to prevent deletion by others.

```bash
ls -ld /tmp
```

Output:

```
drwxrwxrwt ...
```

The final `t` means sticky bit is set — only file owners can delete their own files.

---

Checking Special Bits (Numeric Form)
===================================
Special bits occupy a **fourth digit** before the usual 3‑digit mode.

| Bit | Octal | Combined example |
|------|--------|------------------|
| setuid | 4 | 4755 |
| setgid | 2 | 2755 |
| sticky | 1 | 1755 |

Example:

```bash
chmod 1777 /shared/tmp
```

makes it world‑writable but protected by sticky bit.

---

Security Best Practices
=======================
- Restrict write access whenever possible.  
- Use groups instead of `777`.  
- Never set setuid on custom scripts.  
- Review permissions regularly with `find / -perm -4000` (as root).  
- Keep `/tmp` sticky.

---

Recap
=====
- View: `ls -l`  
- Change: `chmod` (symbolic or octal)  
- Ownership: `chown`, `chgrp`  
- Defaults: `umask`  
- Special bits: `setuid`, `setgid`, `sticky`  

Permissions define *who* can read, write, or execute — the backbone of Linux security.

---

Practice
========
1. Create a script `hello.sh` and make it executable.  
2. Change its group to `students`.  
3. Remove read access for others.  
4. Create `/shared` directory, give group write access, and apply `setgid`.  
5. Create `/public` directory with sticky bit so only owners can delete their files.  
6. Use `ls -l` to verify your results.
