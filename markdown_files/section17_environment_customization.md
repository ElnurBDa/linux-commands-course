Goal
====
Understand how to **customize your shell environment** — what runs when you log in, how variables and aliases work, and how to personalize command history.

---

What Is the Shell Environment?
==============================
When you start a shell session, it loads **configuration files** that define your environment.

They control:
- Which variables are set (e.g., PATH)
- Which aliases and functions are available
- How your prompt looks
- Which scripts run at login or for new terminals

---

Profile and RC Files Overview
=============================
| File | Loaded When | Purpose |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `~/.bash_profile` | login shells | Personal startup settings |
| `~/.bashrc` | interactive shells | Aliases, functions, variables |
| `~/.profile` | login shells (if no .bash_profile) | Environment setup |
| `/etc/profile` | system-wide login setup | Default for all users |
| `/etc/profile.d/*.sh` | system-wide scripts | Extend `/etc/profile` |

---

Login vs Non-Login Shells
=========================
- **Login shell** → first shell after login (e.g., via console or SSH).  
    - Reads `/etc/profile` → `~/.bash_profile` → optionally `~/.bashrc`.

- **Non-login shell** → when opening a new terminal window or running a script.  
    - Reads `~/.bashrc` only.

You can make `.bash_profile` load `.bashrc` manually:

```bash
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
    . ~/.bashrc
fi
```

---

Editing `.bashrc`
=================
Add custom commands, aliases, and variables.

Example entries:

```bash
# Custom aliases
alias ll='ls -lh --color=auto'
alias grep='grep --color=auto'

# Custom PATH
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/scripts"

# Custom prompt
export PS1="\u@\h:\w$ "
```

After editing, reload it:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

Environment Variables — `export`
================================
List environment variables:

```bash
printenv
```

Set a variable for current session:

```bash
MYVAR="hello"
echo $MYVAR
```

Make it available to child processes:

```bash
export MYVAR="hello"
```

Unset a variable:

```bash
unset MYVAR
```

Permanent exports belong in `.bashrc` or `.profile`.

---

The PATH Variable
=================
`PATH` defines where the shell looks for executables.

View it:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

Add a new directory to PATH (for current session):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"
```

To make it permanent, add the export line to your `.bashrc`.

Check where a command is found:

```bash
which python
```

---

Aliases — Shortcuts for Commands
================================
Create simple command shortcuts.

```bash
alias cls='clear'
alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y'
```

View all aliases:

```bash
alias
```

Remove an alias:

```bash
unalias cls
```

For persistence, define them in `~/.bashrc`.

---

Command Completion — `bash-completion`
=====================================
`bash-completion` provides smart tab-completion for many commands.

Check if it’s installed:

```bash
type _init_completion
```

Install if missing (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt install bash-completion
```

Then source it in your `.bashrc` (if not already):

```bash
[[ $PS1 && -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]] &&     . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
```

Now commands like `git`, `docker`, and `ssh` autocomplete intelligently.

---

History Behavior — Environment Variables
========================================
Customize how Bash records your command history.

### `HISTCONTROL`
Defines how duplicates and leading spaces are handled.

```bash
export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups:ignorespace
```

Options:
- `ignoredups` — skip duplicate commands
- `ignorespace` — don’t save commands starting with a space

### `HISTTIMEFORMAT`
Adds timestamps to history entries.

```bash
export HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F %T "
```

View history with time:

```bash
history
```

---

Other Useful History Variables
===============================
| Variable | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `HISTSIZE` | number of commands kept in memory |
| `HISTFILESIZE` | number of lines kept in history file |
| `HISTFILE` | path to history file (usually `~/.bash_history`) |
| `HISTIGNORE` | pattern list to skip saving certain commands |

Example:

```bash
export HISTSIZE=5000
export HISTIGNORE="ls:cd:exit"
```

---

Making Persistent Customizations
===============================
When satisfied with your customizations:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

To apply system-wide for all users, use `/etc/profile.d/custom.sh`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/profile.d/custom.sh
```

Example:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/tools"
alias ll='ls -lh --color=auto'
```

This will auto-load for all users.

---

Recap
=====
- **Startup files:** `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.profile`, `/etc/profile`  
- **Variables:** use `export` to persist and `PATH` to find commands  
- **Aliases:** make common tasks faster  
- **bash-completion:** improves workflow  
- **History tuning:** timestamped and filtered history improves traceability  

Customizing your shell makes Linux truly *yours*.

---

Practice
========
1. Add a custom alias `update` to run system updates.  
2. Add `$HOME/scripts` to your PATH.  
3. Enable timestamps in your history.  
4. Install and test `bash-completion` for `git`.  
5. Create a `/etc/profile.d/myenv.sh` that defines a global variable.
