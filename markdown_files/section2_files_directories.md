Everything is a File
====================
In Linux, almost everything is treated as a **file** — whether it’s a document, folder, device, or socket.

- Regular files → data you create (`.txt`, `.py`, `.jpg`)
- Directories → special files that store file lists
- Devices → `/dev/sda`, `/dev/null`
- Processes → `/proc/<pid>`
- Links → alternate names or shortcuts to files

---

Creating Files — `touch`
========================
`touch` creates an empty file if it doesn’t exist.

```bash
touch notes.txt
```

If the file exists, `touch` updates its *modification timestamp*.

You can create multiple files at once:

```bash
touch a.txt b.txt c.txt
```

---

Reading Files — `cat`, `less`, `nl`
===================================
**cat**: print the whole file to the screen.

```bash
cat notes.txt
```

**less**: scroll interactively (recommended for long files).

```bash
less /etc/passwd
```

Controls inside `less`:
- Space → next page
- b → previous page
- /pattern → search
- q → quit

**nl**: display with line numbers.

```bash
nl notes.txt
```

---

Previewing Files — `head` and `tail`
====================================
See the beginning of a file:

```bash
head notes.txt
```

Show only first 10 lines by default, or specify a count:

```bash
head -n 5 notes.txt
```

See the last lines of a file:

```bash
tail notes.txt
```

Monitor a file as it grows (useful for logs):

```bash
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

Stop following with **Ctrl+C**.

---

Renaming & Moving — `mv`
========================
`mv` moves or renames files and directories.

Rename a file:

```bash
mv oldname.txt newname.txt
```

Move a file into another directory:

```bash
mv report.txt /tmp/
```

Move multiple files:

```bash
mv *.txt ~/Documents/
```

**Tip:** Always use tab completion to avoid typos!

---

Copying Files — `cp`
====================
Copy a single file:

```bash
cp file.txt backup.txt
```

Copy multiple files into a directory:

```bash
cp file1.txt file2.txt ~/Documents/
```

Copy directories recursively:

```bash
cp -r project backup_project
```

Add `-i` to prompt before overwrite, and `-v` for verbose output:

```bash
cp -ivr project backup_project
```

---

Deleting Files & Folders — `rm`, `rmdir`
========================================
Delete a file:

```bash
rm file.txt
```

Delete multiple files:

```bash
rm *.log
```

Remove a directory *recursively* (careful!):

```bash
rm -r old_project
```

Ask before each deletion:

```bash
rm -ri old_project
```

Remove empty directories safely:

```bash
rmdir emptydir
```

---

Creating Directories — `mkdir`
==============================
Create one directory:

```bash
mkdir projects
```

Create nested directories in one go:

```bash
mkdir -p projects/python/scripts
```

`-p` ensures parent folders are created if missing.

---

Inspecting File Metadata — `stat`
=================================
`stat` displays detailed information about a file.

```bash
stat notes.txt
```

Example output:

```bash
File: notes.txt
Size: 4096       Blocks: 8    IO Block: 4096 regular file
Device: 802h/2050d   Inode: 1234567  Links: 1
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (1000/student)  Gid: (1000/student)
Access, Modify, Change times...
```

Shows size, type, permissions, timestamps, and inode (unique identifier).

---

Detecting File Type — `file`
============================
Check what kind of data a file contains.

```bash
file /bin/bash
file photo.jpg
file script.sh
```

Output examples:
- ELF 64-bit executable (for programs)
- JPEG image data
- ASCII text

It’s a quick way to understand what a file *really is*, regardless of its extension.

---

Links — Hard vs Symbolic
=========================
Links are alternative names for files.

**Hard link**: another name pointing to the same data.

```bash
ln notes.txt hardlink_to_notes
```

**Symbolic (soft) link**: a shortcut that points by path.

```bash
ln -s /etc/hosts hosts_link
```

Check with:

```bash
ls -l
```

Symbolic links show an arrow (→) pointing to their target.

---

Differences Between Link Types
==============================
| Feature | Hard Link | Symbolic Link |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Points to | file’s inode (real data) | file path (name) |
| Works across filesystems | ❌ | ✅ |
| Affected if original deleted | stays (until inode reused) | breaks (dangling link) |
| Shown in `ls -l` | same inode number | with → target path |

Use symbolic links for convenience and hard links for redundancy.

---

Safety Tips
===========
- Use `-i` (interactive) with `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` while learning.
- Always double‑check paths before using `rm -r`.
- Use `less` instead of `cat` for large files.
- For log monitoring, combine `tail -f` with `grep`.

Example:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep "error"
```

---

Recap
=====
- **Create** files → `touch`  
- **Read** → `cat`, `less`, `nl`, `head`, `tail -f`  
- **Modify / Move** → `cp`, `mv`, `rm`  
- **Directories** → `mkdir -p`, `rmdir`  
- **Inspect** → `stat`, `file`  
- **Links** → `ln`, `ln -s`

These are your daily drivers for file management in Linux.
