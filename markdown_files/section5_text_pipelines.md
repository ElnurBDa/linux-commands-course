Viewing Text — `less`
=====================
`less` is the most convenient pager for reading long text output or files.

```bash
less /etc/passwd
```

Inside `less`:
- Space / Page Down → next page
- b / Page Up → previous page
- /pattern → search
- n / N → next/previous match
- q → quit

You can pipe output into it too:

```bash
ls -l /etc | less
```

---

Counting Text — `wc`
====================
`wc` = **word count**, but it can count lines, words, and characters.

```bash
wc file.txt
```

Example output:

```
120  560  4200  file.txt
```

Columns = lines, words, bytes.

Count only lines:

```bash
wc -l file.txt
```

You can pipe text into `wc`:

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | wc -l
```

---

Redirection Basics
==================
Every command has three data streams:
- **stdin (0)** — input
- **stdout (1)** — normal output
- **stderr (2)** — error output

You can redirect these streams to files.

---

Output Redirection
==================
Write command output to a file:

```bash
echo Hello > message.txt
```

Append instead of overwrite:

```bash
echo World >> message.txt
```

Redirect both stdout and stderr to a single file:

```bash
command &> output.log
```

Send only errors:

```bash
command 2> errors.log
```

Discard unwanted output:

```bash
command > /dev/null 2>&1
```

---

Input Redirection
=================
Feed a file as input to a command:

```bash
sort < unsorted.txt
```

This reads from `unsorted.txt` instead of keyboard input.

---

Pipelines — `|`
===============
The **pipe operator** (`|`) connects one command’s output to another’s input.

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep bash | wc -l
```

This example:
1. Reads `/etc/passwd`
2. Filters lines containing “bash”
3. Counts them

Pipelines chain tools to form complex processing flows.

---

Here-Documents (`<<`)
=====================
A here‑document feeds a block of text directly into a command.

```bash
cat <<EOF > welcome.txt
Welcome to Linux!
This file was generated from a here-doc.
EOF
```

Everything until `EOF` is sent as input to `cat` and saved into the file.

You can use any marker instead of `EOF`.

---

Here-Strings (`<<<`)
====================
Feed a **single line of text** as input:

```bash
cat <<< "Hello from here-string"
```

Equivalent to:

```bash
echo "Hello from here-string" | cat
```

---

Splitting and Merging Streams — `tee`
=====================================
`tee` writes output to **both the terminal and a file** simultaneously.

```bash
ls -l | tee listing.txt
```

Append instead of overwrite:

```bash
ls -l | tee -a all_listings.txt
```

Useful for saving logs while still viewing output live.

---

Combine Multiple Sources — `paste`
==================================
`paste` merges lines from multiple files side by side.

Example:

```bash
paste names.txt ages.txt
```

Output:

```
Alice   25
Bob     30
Charlie 28
```

You can specify a custom delimiter:

```bash
paste -d ":" file1 file2
```

---

Compare Common Lines — `comm`
=============================
`comm` compares two sorted files line by line.

```bash
comm fileA fileB
```

Columns:
1. Lines unique to fileA
2. Lines unique to fileB
3. Lines common to both

Hide specific columns:

```bash
comm -12 fileA fileB    # show only common lines
```

Files must be **sorted** beforehand.

---

Join Files by Common Field — `join`
===================================
`join` merges two files based on a shared column (like a database join).

Example:

```bash
join users.txt departments.txt
```

Use `-1` and `-2` to choose which fields to join on:

```bash
join -1 1 -2 2 file1 file2
```

Sort both files first for reliable results.

---

Combining Tools in Pipelines
============================
Real power comes from chaining commands.

Example — count unique shell types:

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f7 | sort | uniq -c
```

Another example — save and view results:

```bash
ps aux | grep ssh | tee ssh_processes.txt | wc -l
```

---

Recap
=====
- **less** — scroll through text interactively  
- **wc** — count lines, words, or characters  
- **>**, `>>`, `2>`, `&>` — redirect output and errors  
- **|** — pipe between commands  
- **<<**, `<<<` — here-docs and here-strings  
- **tee**, **paste**, **join**, **comm** — split, merge, and compare streams  

Together, these form the foundation of Linux text processing.
