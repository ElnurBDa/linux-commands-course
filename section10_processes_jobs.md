Goal
====
Learn how to **observe, control, and manage running programs** in Linux.

You’ll understand process IDs, priorities, foreground/background jobs, and safe termination.

---

What Is a Process?
==================
A **process** is a running instance of a program.

Every process has:
- A **PID** (Process ID)
- A **parent process**
- A **state** (running, sleeping, stopped, zombie)
- An **owner** and resource usage (CPU, memory)

All running processes form a hierarchy — you can view it at any time.

---

Viewing Processes — `ps`
========================
`ps` lists running processes.

```bash
ps aux
```

Columns:
- USER — process owner
- PID — process ID
- %CPU, %MEM — resource usage
- STAT — process state
- COMMAND — what’s running

Example:

```
USER     PID %CPU %MEM COMMAND
root       1  0.0  0.1 systemd
student  213  0.1  0.5 bash
student  230  2.5  1.2 python3 script.py
```

---

Interactive Process Viewer — `top`
==================================
Displays a live updating view of running processes.

```bash
top
```

Common controls inside `top`:
- **P** — sort by CPU
- **M** — sort by memory
- **K** — kill a process by PID
- **Q** — quit

More colorful alternative (if installed): `htop`

```bash
htop
```

Use F6 to sort columns, F9 to kill, F10 to quit.

---

Finding Processes — `pgrep` and `pkill`
=======================================
Search processes by name:

```bash
pgrep bash
```

This prints PIDs for all matching processes.

Kill by name (no need for PID):

```bash
pkill firefox
```

Force kill with signal 9 (SIGKILL):

```bash
pkill -9 firefox
```

---

Killing by PID — `kill`
=======================
Stop a process using its PID.

Example:

```bash
ps aux | grep sleep
kill 1234
```

Graceful termination (default SIGTERM 15):

```bash
kill 1234
```

Force kill if unresponsive:

```bash
kill -9 1234
```

---

Kill Multiple at Once — `killall`
=================================
Ends all processes with the same name.

```bash
killall python3
```

Useful for stopping multiple instances of a command quickly.

---

Adjusting Priority — `nice`
===========================
Each process has a **niceness** value (priority).  
Lower value → higher priority.

Start a command with custom priority:

```bash
nice -n 10 script.sh
```

Default nice value = 0.  
Range = **-20 (highest)** to **19 (lowest)**.

---

Changing Priority of Running Process — `renice`
===============================================
Change niceness for an existing process:

```bash
renice +5 -p 2134
```

Example: lower CPU priority of a background task.

Only root can increase (raise) priority (negative nice values).

---

Foreground and Background Jobs
==============================
When you run a command normally, it runs in the **foreground**.

To run it in the **background**, append `&`:

```bash
sleep 60 &
```

Output example:

```
[1] 1234
```

`[1]` is the job number, `1234` is the PID.

---

Listing Jobs — `jobs`
=====================
Show jobs started from the current terminal:

```bash
jobs
```

Example output:

```
[1]+  Running  sleep 60 &
```

Jobs are tied to your shell session.

---

Bringing Jobs to Foreground or Background
=========================================
Bring job to foreground:

```bash
fg %1
```

Send a suspended job to background again:

```bash
bg %1
```

Stop a running job temporarily with **Ctrl+Z**.

---

Disowning Jobs — `disown`
=========================
Detach a job from the current shell so it keeps running after you close the terminal.

```bash
disown %1
```

This removes it from the job table.

Example workflow:

```bash
sleep 300 &
disown %1
exit
```

The job keeps running even after logout.

---

Persistent Background Processes — `nohup`
=========================================
`nohup` runs a command immune to hangups or logouts.

```bash
nohup long_task.sh &
```

Output is redirected to `nohup.out` by default.

Perfect for running long scripts or background services safely.

---

Signals Overview
================
Processes can receive signals (software interrupts).

Common ones:

| Signal | Number | Meaning |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `SIGTERM` | 15 | Graceful termination |
| `SIGKILL` | 9 | Force kill, cannot be trapped |
| `SIGSTOP` | 19 | Pause process |
| `SIGCONT` | 18 | Resume process |

Send custom signals:

```bash
kill -STOP 2134   # pause
kill -CONT 2134   # resume
```

---

Combining Process Tools
=======================
Practical usage example:

```bash
ps aux | grep nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
pgrep nginx
pkill -HUP nginx
```

- View → restart → verify → reload gracefully

---

Monitoring Processes Efficiently
================================
Show top memory users:

```bash
ps -eo pid,comm,%mem --sort=-%mem | head
```

Show tree of process relationships:

```bash
pstree -p | less
```

These are great for debugging and audits.

---

Recap
=====
- View: `ps aux`, `top`, `htop`
- Find / kill: `pgrep`, `pkill`, `kill`, `killall`
- Adjust priority: `nice`, `renice`
- Manage jobs: `&`, `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`, `disown`, `nohup`
- Know signals: graceful vs forceful termination

Mastering these makes you fluent in process control and multitasking.

---

Practice
========
1. Run `sleep 120` in background and list it with `jobs`.  
2. Bring it to foreground, then stop it with **Ctrl+Z**.  
3. Resume in background with `bg`.  
4. Disown it and close your terminal — confirm it stays active via `ps`.  
5. Start a command with low priority using `nice`.  
6. Use `top` to monitor and `kill` to stop it gracefully.
